<!--3 ways we can add css in html 1. inline 2. internal 3. external css.  
Inline css: Inline CSS is the technique to define the single element with the insert style sheets in an HTML document(use this css ideally try to don't use it. )

internal css : Internal CSS is a form of CSS using which you can add CSS to HTML documents. It helps to design the layout of a single HTML web page and change the styles of a web page within HTML code.(use it when your webpages are very small )

external css : External CSS is a form of CSS which is used to add styling to multiple HTML pages at a time. It helps to design the layout of many HTML web pages simultaneously. The external CSS is always saved with the . css extension, and through this file, we can change the complete style of our HTML web page. (most cases you will use it for bigger projects.)
