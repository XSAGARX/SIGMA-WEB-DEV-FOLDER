<!-- Core web vitals= Core Web Vitals is a set of metrics that measure real-world user experience for loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability of the page.

<!--FID (first input delay): The time from when a user first interacts with your page (when they clicked a link, tapped on a button, and so on) to the time when the browser responds to that interaction. This measurement is taken from whatever interactive element that the user first clicks. This is important on pages where the user needs to do something, because this is the delay before the page becomes interactive.
Group FID shown in the report means that 75% of visits to a URL in this group had this value or better.-->

<!-- CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift): CLS measures the sum total of all individual layout shift scores for every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the entire lifespan of the page. The score is zero to any positive number, where zero means no shifting and the larger the number, the more layout shift on the page. This is important because having pages elements shift while a user is trying to interact with it is a bad user experience. If you can't seem to find the reason for a high value, try interacting with the page to see how that affects the score.-->
