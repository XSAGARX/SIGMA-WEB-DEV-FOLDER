<!--SVG in HTML
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) has become an indispensable part of modern web development. SVG enables developers to create high-quality, scalable graphics that look crisp at any size or resolution. In this blog post, we'll explore the basics of using SVG in HTML, its benefits, and some practical examples.
What is SVG?
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Unlike raster images like PNGs or JPGs, SVGs are not pixel-based. They're composed of vectorsâ€”mathematical formulas that describe shapes, paths, and fills. This means SVGs can be resized without losing quality.
